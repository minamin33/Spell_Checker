Write a spell checker program to accomplish the following task:

Read all of the words from a dictionary file, and store them in a java ArrayList data structure.

Now ask the user to enter a word that you will search for in the ArrayList. If you find it, print the location/index at which it was found. Otherwise, print a message indicating that the word was not found. You should consider the first word to be in position 1. Continue this process until the user searches for the word stop.

If a word happens to appear more than once in the array you should print only the first location at which it occurred.

An example of your program output is listed below.

(As usual, the user's input is underlined.)

File name: dict10.txt (You can also hard code this file name in source code, instead of as a user input)

Search for: cat

`cat' was found in position 3

Search for: file

`file' was found in position 6

Search for: aardvark

Sorry, `aardvark' was not found

Search for: apple

`apple' was found in position 1

Search for: iphone

`iphone' was found in position 9

Search for: stop

Bye!
